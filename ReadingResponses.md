### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

"You might know your George Eliot from your George Meredith, but you won’t have learned anything meaningful about literature, because your sample size is absurdly small. Since no feasible amount of reading can fix that, what’s called for is a change not in scale but in strategy." I disagree with the statement you won't have learned anything meaningful from only reading what one person is cable of in a life time. I think there are potentially some benefits to having a database derived from distant reading; but, in the end writing is an art. You woulden't make a database of the worlds most famous paintings and expect that to have the same effect as enjoying the art in person.

"The trouble is that Moretti isn’t studying a science. Literature is an artificial universe, and the written word, unlike the natural world, can’t be counted on to obey a set of laws." This section of the article allowed me to take a step back and put distant reading into perspective. As I was reading, I was doubting the standardization of this practice as texts are often so different from each other. This section helped solidify my opinion.

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I
"One way to think about how the process of topic modeling works is to imagine working through an article with a set of highlighters. As you read through the article, you use a different color for the key words of themes within the paper as you come across them." This metaphor used multiple times throughout the first article was very helpful in terms of fully understanding topic modeling. As the subject got more complicated, it was easy to apply the highlighter idea to wrap my mind around tougher concepts. 

"To put this another way, topic modeling can identify discourses as well as subject categories and embedded languages. Naturally we also need other kinds of evidence to produce a history of the discipline, including social and institutional evidence that may not be fully manifest in discourse." The idea of viewing topics as discourses is one that confused me. It was mentioned a few times through the multiple readings, but I am just unsure if I have fully made the connection. I few a topic as perhaps some small interprise within a discourse.
