### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

"You might know your George Eliot from your George Meredith, but you won’t have learned anything meaningful about literature, because your sample size is absurdly small. Since no feasible amount of reading can fix that, what’s called for is a change not in scale but in strategy." I disagree with the statement you won't have learned anything meaningful from only reading what one person is cable of in a life time. I think there are potentially some benefits to having a database derived from distant reading; but, in the end writing is an art. You woulden't make a database of the worlds most famous paintings and expect that to have the same effect as enjoying the art in person.

"The trouble is that Moretti isn’t studying a science. Literature is an artificial universe, and the written word, unlike the natural world, can’t be counted on to obey a set of laws." This section of the article allowed me to take a step back and put distant reading into perspective. As I was reading, I was doubting the standardization of this practice as texts are often so different from each other. This section helped solidify my opinion.
