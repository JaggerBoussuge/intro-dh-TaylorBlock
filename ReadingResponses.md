### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

"You might know your George Eliot from your George Meredith, but you won’t have learned anything meaningful about literature, because your sample size is absurdly small. Since no feasible amount of reading can fix that, what’s called for is a change not in scale but in strategy." I disagree with the statement you won't have learned anything meaningful from only reading what one person is cable of in a life time. I think there are potentially some benefits to having a database derived from distant reading; but, in the end writing is an art. You woulden't make a database of the worlds most famous paintings and expect that to have the same effect as enjoying the art in person.

"The trouble is that Moretti isn’t studying a science. Literature is an artificial universe, and the written word, unlike the natural world, can’t be counted on to obey a set of laws." This section of the article allowed me to take a step back and put distant reading into perspective. As I was reading, I was doubting the standardization of this practice as texts are often so different from each other. This section helped solidify my opinion.

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I
"One way to think about how the process of topic modeling works is to imagine working through an article with a set of highlighters. As you read through the article, you use a different color for the key words of themes within the paper as you come across them." This metaphor used multiple times throughout the first article was very helpful in terms of fully understanding topic modeling. As the subject got more complicated, it was easy to apply the highlighter idea to wrap my mind around tougher concepts. 

"To put this another way, topic modeling can identify discourses as well as subject categories and embedded languages. Naturally we also need other kinds of evidence to produce a history of the discipline, including social and institutional evidence that may not be fully manifest in discourse." The idea of viewing topics as discourses is one that confused me. It was mentioned a few times through the multiple readings, but I am just unsure if I have fully made the connection. I few a topic as perhaps some small interprise within a discourse. 

### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II
### “Mining the Dispatch” 
“Exactly what is meant by a topic in the context of topic modeling is a bit abstract. A topic is a group of words that are likely to appear together in the same document, and a topic modeling program processes a group of documents to identify clusters of words—topics—that often appear in the same document together.” This was a bit confusing for me. I understand that topic modeling helps discover the words that are most prominent throughout a document relative to their context. I just do not really understand how this article is using the word “together”. Does that mean the words in the list appear together in physical distance? 

“Could it be that enslaved African American men and women destabilized the slave hiring market by using the chaos of war mobilization in and around Richmond to run away in increasing numbers? This is a question that can be formulated from but not answered by these graphs alone, that will require using more traditional research methods to investigate.” This passage helped me apply the ideas of topic modeling to the more qualitative questions I am used to answering as a Rhetoric and Communications major. It allowed me to see the bigger picture of the significance of topic modeling. 

### “Signs at 40”
“Another possibility is the “intrusion” of a word into a topic where it seems out of place. This has the result of linking articles in which that intrusive word is prominent with a topic in a potentially misleading way.” I am a bit unclear about what an intrusive word is. Is it referring to a word that can appear in a text even if it is not related to the topic? 

“We have omitted from consideration a list of stop words (including very common words like the and and, personal names, and certain terms common to article reference lists) which distort the modeling results. The same applies to very rare words; we have also omitted words occurring four or fewer times in the whole corpus.” This section as a whole (Modeling Choices) helped me understand more about the importance of “stop words”, and how to understand the data given by MALLET. 

### “Text Analysis of Trump’s Tweets”
Overall, this article conceptually made sense. The code and mathematical equations used were definitely confusing, but what they meant and how they applied to the tweets made sense. One particular passage I found interesting was, “We then want to measure how much more likely the Android account is to use an emotionally-charged term relative to the iPhone account. Since this is count data, we can use a Poisson test to measure the difference.” I found this interesting because the author is using this quantitative information to judge and make connections between emotions. 

### "Data Miners Dig for Answers"
"The researchers aren’t declaring that Mr. Capote wrote the passage but say that at this fraught moment in the narrative, Ms. Lee may have been subliminally using words as Mr. Capote did—or she may have been pulled off her typical authorial voice for some other reason." This section of the reading did not make much sense to me. If it is possible she lost her voice, or was using diction of someone else for a particular scene, how do we know her original voice? It could be from previous novels, but isn't it possible that the scene called for different diction? I think this is a broader question that applies to a lot of topic modeling: isn't possible for a writers tone, diction and writing style to change throughout a longer novel as the scene requires?
