## The Process
Geo-referencing is a complicated, yet rewarding process that allows us to overlay maps and analyze their differences versus similarities. We began this project by choosing a city. Personally, I chose the city closest to my hometown, Boston. The first step in ArcMap was to add the first layer, a basemap for the project. We used the “topography” map that included streets, parks and bodies of water. This would allow us to add points on the maps later on. Following this, we added the 1938 city data on top of the “topography” map. After we had both maps added to ArcMap, we had to align the maps using points. The importance of adding control points was to make sure our maps were properly aligned. This way, when we analyzed the data, the layered maps would be an accurate spatial depiction of Boston from 1938 to today. After adding ten points to the layers, the map itself was complete. The next step of the project was analyzing the maps to discover the similarities and differences. 

## Contextualize 
To begin to conceptualize and understand this project, it is imperative to understand this history behind the 1938 map. Essentially the map is divided into different areas that have each received a “grade” representing whether or not it is a suitable residential area. There was a long list of items to consider when giving an area a grade. This included, “Homeownership rate; age and type of housing; social status of residents; adequacy of public utilities; access to schools, churches, businesses, and transportation.” (Hiller, Pg. 80) This all seems fairly standard until you get into the final item to consider, “The presence of race-restrictive covenants aimed at painting homogeneity.” For an area to get an “A” rating, it had to lack diversity and be consistently white. Essentially, the more diverse the area, the lower grade it would receive. (Hiller, Pg. 80)

This brings us to the concept of redlining which addresses the question, “How did the government maintain homogeneity?” Essentially, there were laws and practices put in place that would prevent non-whites from living in the more suitable areas of a city. This was occurring while there were programs being launched in order to assist white people in getting jobs in order to afford a home. However,  “At the very same time, federal housing programs helped codify and expand practices of racial and class segregation.  They ensured, moreover, that rampant real estate speculation and environmental degradation would accompany America's remarkable economic recovery and growth.” (Nelson et. al., Introduction) This practice was called redlining, which means that the government would create high mortgages that most minorities could not afford. This promoted segregation and poverty among minorities. 

## Questions Generated 
The map I created definitely raised a few questions for me about the spatial history of Boston. For starters, there were not many areas that were considered hazardous. In fact, majority were fairly suitable living areas. Using the logic stated in the last section, this would indicate a majority of white people in Boston, with a few condensed areas of diversity. However, with an understanding of Boston’s history of gang violence, it is clear that redlining perhaps did not accomplish much. It is not frequently discussed that most of Boston’s gang violence was white crimes; however, African Americans were still given the reputation of being violent and unsafe to live around. Ironic, isn’t it?  

Additionally, this made me consider how redlining effects Boston today. Prices to live in Boston today are incredibly high. I have heard from many friends who go to college in Boston how insanely expensive it is to live off campus. Are these prices effected by redlining? Are neighborhoods surrounding college campuses considered prime real estate? This map has made me consider the relationship between the grades of these areas in the past, and today. 

## Census Tract 
First of all, looking at the census of the state of Massachusetts for 2016, 81.8% of the population was white alone, and 8.6% was African American. This was not a promising statistic when analyzing a particular area.

This is an image of a particularly white area that I have decided to analyze. I choose this spot as I am familiar with the area, and I have an idea of where it is in relation to the rest of Boston. In the 1938 map provided by “Mapping Inequalities,” this area received an “A” grade. This indicated that the area was mostly white, and those of different races were actively kept out. As you can see from the image (in the circled area), the 2010 census showed that this area is still only white, with a whopping zero African Americans in this area. After reading the census for 2016, I was not entirely surprised by this; however, the fact that zero African Americans lived there ultimately shows not much progress. This was definitely eye opening. 

## Constraints, Critiques, and Ideas
To my understanding, space is created by the physical boundaries of a location. For example, when look at these maps we are looking at a larger space encompassing many smaller spaces denoted by outlines. Place, however, is a bit different. There are no outlined boundaries for place. It is created by the imagination as a location for where a story occurred. Place is determined more by culture, and those who make up the location. 

I think a big constraint for this project and “Mapping Inequalities” lies in the lack of representation of place in these maps. Bodenhamer stated, “Essentially, GIS and its related technologies currently allow users to determine a geometry of space. In the context of the humanities, it will be necessary to move GIS from this more limited quantitative representation of space to facilitate an understanding of place within time and the role that place occupies in humanities disciplines.” (Bodenhamer, Pg 4)  These maps that we created and looked at have divulged a bit into the humanities world. We are using these physical spaces to analyze policies and public opinion at the time. However, I am still left with a number of questions. 

It would be interesting to gather some opinions from African Americans during this time regarding their space and place. Regardless of the policies that restricted their living conditions, did the community use this segregation to create a culturally rich place? Or was the location so poor, that the place was simply miserable? More insights on what life was like for these people, rather than just looking at the numbers, could benefit this project greatly. In creating a new project, I think it would be interesting to create a map with the space still outlined by redlining. However, within each location, have the characteristics of the place. This could include more photos, quotes, and further insight on what life was like. I think this would further access the humanities questions surrounding place and space.
