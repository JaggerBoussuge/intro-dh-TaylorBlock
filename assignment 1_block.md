# Assignment 1
For this assignment, I chose to collect data on the most viewed series finales for television programs. With the data I collected, my goal was to examine how society watches television. After collecting this data, I realized there are a number of questions you can answer. 		How does society watch television? We can see that there has been a large change in how people watch television from the correlation between the dates and viewership. Within the last 10 years, no series finales have made this list; however, there are plenty of programs that have ended and I do not believe less people are watching television. This data serves as proof that we have switched from watching programs live on television to watching them through other mediums like Hulu and Netflix. Who was dominant in creating the most popular series finales? From the data we can see that all except one creator are white males. This is not a surprise, considering the dates for the shows, but it certainly stands as proof of inequalities within society. What were the dominant networks? This was one of the more interesting take aways from the data that I was not really expecting. There are only 3 networks that these finales premiered on: NBC, ABC, and CBS. Each of these networks has a political affiliation, so it is interesting to see how people were reacting to and which programs they were watching with this knowledge. These questions and even more can be answered by looking at this data. Keeping track of these records, and updating them as we go is important in understand how society is changing in the ways in which we consume media. Going off this study, it would be interesting to look at where Netflix and online steaming came into the timeline to account for the decrease in live viewership of current television programs.
